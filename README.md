## Inspiration
This project is built to provide a common platform for developers and communities to engage and interact with each other. Here an amplify web dashboard is built to centrally manage the interactions of developers with the peer communities. This ecosystem is expected to house a lot of discussions in real time. For the benefit of time one use case is taken to unite the developer with the community and to bring accountability.

Here user community will be hosting events, and developers use to submit the CFP for being part of the sessions. The discussions are captured in the dashboard and this could be scaled up well both by the developers and the communities.

Soon this ecosystem is expected to bring more communities and it is easier to securely share their assets with this serverless solution. 
## What it does

This app currently helps users to submit CFP and communities could review them in real-time

## How we built it
This project is built using amplify studio, figma with low code as possible. Besides this, it also will use React, Typescript, and Aws CDK to scale up and highly extendible

## Challenges we ran into
Mainly the timeline of this hackathon only gave us a couple of weekends most of which is during the holiday season, so I have to do this very quickly starting from prototyping to amplifying studio beside the react code wiring in a short time

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It is a great opportunity to learn by doing hands-on and share our progress with the community.

## What we learned
I am getting confident every day with figma and amplify studio in building this react based, graphql-powered dashboard

## What's next for DEV COM
As I mentioned already wanted to make this a central repo for multiple developer communities to interact with their users.

Due to time constraints as a single dev, I could only make one part of this puzzle with minor refinements, and simple data transformations pending

## DEV site link 

Will be provided for review in discord for someone to check, they could use them once I grant roles to screen with their google sign in

## Pending work

1) react control did not render for the file upload(which delayed the initial video release)
2) besides this the rest of the features are for enriching the ecosystem
Multiple communities are registered
Multiple users can work between communities
A page for every event/faqs with banners
Users can post on every page, and others could comment
Live interaction with community members other integrations
