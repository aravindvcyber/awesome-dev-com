# awesome-dev-com

## Inspiration
This project is built to provide a common platform for developers and communities to engage and interact with each other. Here a an amplify web dashboard is built to centrally manage the interactions of developers with the peer communities. This ecosystems is expected to house a lot of discussions in real-time. For the benefit of time one use case is taken to unite the developer with the community and to bring accountability.

Here user community will be hosting events, and developers use to submit the CFP for being part of the sessions. The discussions are captured in the dashboard and this could be scaled up well both by the developers and the communities.

Soon this ecosystem is expected to bring more communities and it is easier to securely share their assets with this serverless solution. 
## What it does

## How we built it
This project is built using amplify studio, figma with low code as much as possible. Besides this it also will use React, Typescript and Aws CDK to scale up
## Challenges we ran into
Mainly the timeline of this hackathon only gave us couple of weekend most of which is during holiday season, so I have to this very quick starting from prototyping to amplify studio besides the react code wiring in a short time
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It is a great opportunity to learn by doing hand-son and share our progress with the community.

## What we learned
I am getting confident everyday with figma and amplify studio in building this react based, graphql powered dashboard
## What's next for DEV COM
As I mentioned already wanted to make this a central repo for multiple developer communities to interact with their users.

Due to time constraints as a single dev, I could only make one part of this puzzle with minor refinements, and simple data transformations pending
